summary: "Enrique Amig&oacute; will explores a comprehensive taxonomy of evaluation dimensions for large language models, emphasizing the need to consider aspects like harmful content, explainability, hallucination, informativeness, and reasoning capabilities alongside traditional effectiveness benchmarks."
abstract: 'So far, in information retrieval, recommendation systems, and artificial intelligence in general, automatic 
offline evaluation benchmarks (based on comparisons between the output and a gold standard) have focused on **effectiveness**, 
alongside parallel research on some issues such as bias or diversity. However, with the emergence of large language models, 
it has become necessary to consider a broader spectrum of evaluation dimensions, including aspects such as **harmful content**, 
**explainability power**, **hallucination**, **informativeness** or **reasoning capabilities**. This talk presents a taxonomy of evaluation
dimensions, as well as existing benchmarks and metrics, highlighting their strengths and limitations. The goal is to provide
a comprehensive overview that enables the design of research work from different perspectives, as well as to outline a 
general methodology for offline evaluation of intelligent systems.'
