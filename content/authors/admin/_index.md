Platforms like Amazon and YouTube train their recommender systems by understanding user interest from their interaction history. In the normal days, no problem. But during extraordinary events like the COVID-19 pandemic, people tend to exhibit unusual behavior, such as panic buying. 

My work is to differentiate between genuine user interests and irrational behavior, in order to improve the quality of recommendations.
