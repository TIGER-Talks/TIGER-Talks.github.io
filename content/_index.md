        **Date:** 11 June, 2025
        
        **Time:** 2:30 PM - 3:30 PM (AEDT)
        
        **Location:** **B080.11.009** at RMIT University & MS Teams
        
        **Abstract:**
        This talk is divided into two parts. In the first, we'll explore the latest advances in artificial intelligence, from large language models (LLMs) to cutting-edge applications across industries. We'll also touch on the intriguing question of whether AI could ever approach a state of "infinite intelligence", and what that might mean for both research and society. In the second part, I'll share my personal journey transitioning from a PhD in machine learning to a role as Principal Data Scientist. We'll discuss the key differences between academic and industry ML, real-world case studies, and offer actionable career advice for PhD students interested in moving to industryâ€”covering skills to build, common pitfalls, and how to bridge the gap between research and practical impact.
