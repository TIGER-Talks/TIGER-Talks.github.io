        **Speaker:** [Marwah Alaofi](https://marwahalaofi.com/)
        
        **Date:** 14th February 2025
        
        **Time:** 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM
        
        **Location:** RMIT University & Online
        
        **Abstract:**
        Large Language Models ( LLM s) are increasingly being used to assess the relevance of information objects. 
        This work reports on experiments to study the labelling of short texts (i.e., passages) for relevance, using 
        multiple open-source and proprietary LLMs. While the overall agreement of some LLM s with human judgements is
        comparable to human-to-human agreement measured in previous research, LLM s are more likely to label passages
        as relevant compared to human judges, indicating that LLM labels denoting non-relevance are more reliable than
        those indicating relevance.
