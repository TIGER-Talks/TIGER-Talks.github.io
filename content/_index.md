        **Speaker:** {{% mention "Enrique Amigo" %}}
        
        **Date:** 20 February, 2025
        
        **Time:** 12:00 PM - 1:00 PM (AEDT)
        
        **Location:** **B080.06.005** at RMIT University & MS Teams
        
        **Abstract:**
        So far, in information retrieval, recommendation systems, and artificial intelligence in general, automatic 
        offline evaluation benchmarks (based on comparisons between the output and a gold standard) have focused on **effectiveness**,
        alongside parallel research on some issues such as bias or diversity. However, with the emergence of large language models,
        it has become necessary to consider a broader spectrum of evaluation dimensions, including aspects such as **harmful content**,
        **explainability power**, **hallucination**, **informativeness** or **reasoning capabilities**. This talk presents a taxonomy of evaluation
        dimensions, as well as existing benchmarks and metrics, highlighting their strengths and limitations. The goal is to provide
        a comprehensive overview that enables the design of research work from different perspectives, as well as to outline a
        general methodology for offline evaluation of intelligent systems.
